System Requirements

  This game requires running Windows XP with the latest update of DirectX 9.0. You can get the latest DirectX update by going to www.microsoft.com and searching for DirectX downloads.



Story and Rules

  You are a sleepkeeper. It is your mission to help the person you are assigned to have the longest, happiest dreams possible. Tonight, you have been assigned to Puffball. In the game, you will see Puffball inside a cloud. The cloud represents Puffball's dream, and the more engrossed he is in his dream, the larger the cloud will be. The dream cloud will gradually shrink over time. If the dream shrinks to nothing, Puffball will wake up from his sleep. To prevent this from happening, you must let good things enter Puffball's dream. When a good thing enters the dream, it will get larger. However, good things are not the only things trying to enter the dream. There are also bad things that try to enter the dream, and if they enter, the dream will get smaller. To prevent this, you must use the mouse to draw rainbow-colored dream lines to intercept the bad things. When a dream line collides with any thing, both the line and the thing will disappear. Dream lines do not differentiate between good and bad things, so you must be careful to draw your lines to intercept the bad things while letting the good things into the dream.



Controls

  Press the left mouse button to start drawing a line. Move the mouse to draw your line, and then release the left mouse button to complete the line. Things are only affected by lines that have been completed. You can have up to four lines on screen at once. If you try to draw a fifth line, the first line that you drew will be removed, and the fifth line will be drawn. Press the right mouse button if you wish to remove a line. The line that will be removed is the most recently drawn line that is still on the screen. Pressing Esc on the keyboard will return you to the title screen.



Comments

  A few minor things were changed between this version and the version that was demonstrated at the 48 Hour Contest. The changes are:
  - modified the code to play mp3 files instead of wavs for the music
  - add display of your final score on the "Enter high score initials" screen

The high score list that comes with this version is the high score list that was formed by people playing the game at the contest, along with a few plays by the development team afterwards.
