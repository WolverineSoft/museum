        <p>A platformer I made for the 2020 shammy game jam hosted by WolverineSoft Studios. It&#x27;s very short but likely waaaay too hard because I&#x27;m the only one who ever playtested it&nbsp;. Some parts will have lower visibility than I would have liked&nbsp;given that I gave up trying to set the dimensions in favor of submitting in time</p>
