Platform: Windows

Two blocks have come together to play out the ultimate battle between orange and blue.
Two players, one orange and one blue, will compete by firing projectiles at one another.
The players will guess which angle and velocity to fire at, as well where to move.  The
surrounding environment is affected differently by the projectiles depending on its 
color.  In order to win, a player must hit his or her opponent and avoid being hit.

Players choose which level they would like to play as well as the level of gravity to be
used.  Once the game begins, each player must enter the angle and power of their shots
and where they will move to.  Both shots are fired at the same time, and the projectiles
may interact with one another.

While the game has no online connectivity, it has been played online via an instant
messaging program.  Essentially two players can pick the same level and gravity on
separate computers and send their angles and velocities to one another, which can then
be entered on the separate computers.

Note: if you get some kind of nonsense about vb6 run-time something, or msvbvm60.dll 
specifically, you need to install the visual basic 6.0 run-time dlls.
