       <pre>Welcome
Thank you for downloading Squatter House! We hope that you and your friends enjoy it. Squatter House is a 2-player online-only game for Windows PCs. An internet connection is required to play this game.

What’s Going On Here?
Many people in the world could use some rest and relaxation. One day, one of these people receives a letter informing them that they have won a free vacation home from a real estate sweepstakes. The person arrives at their new vacation home, eager for a calming experience, only to find a squatter has taken up residence! You can play as the squatter or the rightful owner of the home, who will chase the squatter. If you are the chaser, you must chase and catch the squatter so you can kick him out and finally relax. If you choose to be the squatter, you will win if you can "lay claim" to your territory, by collecting waypoints (colored squares with numbers) in numerical order. In the game, you will choose a character and a house plan (maze), and your opponent will do the same. Each player is confined by the house plan they choose, but your opponent doesn't have to choose the same house plan as you. This means that while you are bound by the walls in your house plan, the other player may be able to disregard some of those walls! 

Getting Started
The first step is to download Squatter House to your computer (if you are reading this, you have probably already done this).  After you have downloaded the zip file and have unzipped it to a place of your choice, you are ready to go. 

How to Find Your IP Address
Make sure both you and your friend have a working internet connection. Before playing, it is a good idea to write down both players’ IP addresses. An IP address is basically the address of a computer on the internet. You will need this address to connect with your friend’s computer.  To find out the IP address of a computer, first click on Start Menu. Then click on Run. A small window will come up asking you for the name of a program. Type in the word “cmd” and click Okay. A new command prompt window will appear. Type “ipconfig” and press Enter. The window will now display IP information, including your IP address. Write down this address and tell your friend what it is. Now you are ready to play.

Starting the Game
Open the Squatter House folder. Double-click on Squatter House.exe to start up the game. Depending on the speed of your computer, you may see a loading screen. After the game loads, you will see the Wolverine Soft logo. If you wait, it will disappear, or you can press Enter to skip to the next screen. Following the Wolverine Soft logo is a reminder to not use drugs. Like the Wolverine Soft logo, you can wait for the screen to disappear, or you can press Enter to skip it. You will now be at the title screen. Press Enter to go to the Network Connect screen. One player will need to host the game, and another player will need to join the game. If you are hosting, click the “Host” button. If you are joining a game, click on the black text box and type in the other player’s IP address. Then click the “Join” button. Once you and the other player have connected to each other, you will go to the Character Select screen. Click on the picture of the character you wish to be, and click on the Left and Right arrow buttons until you see a maze you like. When you are ready, click the “Go” button. When both players are ready, you will see a short story sequence. After both players have finished watching the story sequence, the game will begin. When a game has ended, both players will be taken back to the character select screen, and you can select a new character and maze and play again.

Controls:

w or Up Arrow:	   move up one space
a or Left Arrow:	   move left one space
s or Down Arrow:	   move down one space
d or Right Arrow:	   move right one space
Space Bar or Enter:  Use your special move (if you have enough Bling)


Title Screen
  

This is pretty simple. Just press Enter to go to the Network Connect screen.


Network Connect
  

This is where you will connect to your friend. Each game needs a host and a joiner. The host will click on the “Host” button. The joiner will type in the host’s IP address and then click the “Join” button. If you have clicked one of the buttons (which means you are waiting for a connection) and you change your mind, you can click the “Quit” button to cancel. If you click “Quit” and you are not waiting for a connection, the game will close.

Note: If you are the host of the game, you will start off as the squatter. If you join a game, you will be the chaser. 

Character Select
  
On this screen, you will select your character and maze. To select your character, click on the picture on the character you want. To select your maze, click on the Left and Right arrow buttons to find a maze that you like. When you are ready, click the “Go!!” button, and you will be waiting for the other player to make their selection. When both players have selected, you will advance to a story scene. While you are waiting for the other player, if you change your mind, you can click the “Quit” button to reselect your character and maze. If you click “Quit” when you haven’t clicked “Go!!” you will return to the Network Connect screen.
This screen also displays the number of wins and losses you have had since starting the game, your currently selected character, that character’s special move, and the cost in Bling to use that special move (this is shown just above the “Go!!” button).

Story Scene
  
The story scenes will introduce the chaser and the squatter for this round. Press Enter to advance to the next scene. When both players have seen all of the scenes, the game will begin.

Game
  
This is where the game is played. You will see your maze, the powerups, and both players’ characters. If you are the chaser, you win by catching the squatter. If you are the squatter, you win by collecting the different kinds of waypoints in numerical order. Waypoints are colored squares with numbers. There will be three different kinds (numbered “1” “2” and “3”) and there will be two copies of each kind (so the chaser can’t just stand on the next one the squatter needs to get). In addition to waypoints, there are powerups scattered about the mazes. The details of these are listed in the “Powerups” section of this manual. To get a powerup or waypoint, just walk over it with your character. When a player wins, both players will be taken back to the Character Select screen.
On the left side of the screen, you will see status boxes with the character’s pictures in them. These status boxes show how much Bling a player has, and that number will flash if you have enough Bling to use that character’s special move. The status box for a player also tells whether that player is being affected by any powerups that last for a limited time. If the player is being affected by one of those powerups, the powerup’s icon will be displayed in one of the black boxes on that player’s status box. 

Powerups

Powerups are things you can pick up to give yourself an advantage over the other player. Their names and effects are listed below.

    Bling: Collect Bling so you can pay to use your special ability. When you have enough Bling, press the Space Bar to use your special ability.

    Rotate Left: Rotate your opponent’s maze left by 90 degrees.

    Rotate Right: Rotate your opponent’s maze right by 90 degrees.

    Switch Mazes: Switch mazes with your opponent.

    Lights On: See your opponent’s maze overlaid on your own for a short amount of time.

    Lights Off: Your opponent can’t see his or her maze for a short amount of time.

    Confuse: Your opponent’s directional controls are reversed (up is down and left is right) for a short amount of time.

    Scatter Waypoints: Changes the positions of the waypoints to new, random, positions.

    Switch Roles: If you are the squatter, you become the chaser, and vice versa. Your opponent becomes the opposite of you.

    Invisibility: Your opponent can’t see you for a short amount of time.

    Teleport: Moves your character to a random position.


How to Make Your Own Mazes
You can make you own mazes to use in Squatter House. This section will explain the details of making mazes and putting them into the game. All of the data for the mazes is in the file Mazes.txt in your Squatter House folder. Mazes are composed of square tiles. There are three sizes of mazes: 6 by 6 tiles, 12 by 12 tiles, and 16 by 16 tiles. Each tile can have walls on the top, bottom, left, or right sides. The Mazes.txt file is formatted in the following way: the first number in the file is the number of mazes that the file has, and after this, there is data for each maze. Each set of data for a maze is formatted in the following way: the first number is the width of the maze (either 6 for a 6x6 maze, 12 for a 12x12 maze, or 16 for a 16x16 maze), and then numbers representing each square tile in the maze. The numbers in the first row represent the tiles in the top row of the maze (from left to right), the numbers in the second row represent the tiles in the row below the top, and so on. Now that you know this, you are probably wondering how to convert a square with walls into a number. Below is the chart to do this:

  0 = No walls
  1 = Wall on the right side of the square only
  2 = Wall on the top of the square only
  3 = Walls on the right side and top of the square
  4 = Wall on the left side of the square only
  5 = Walls on the left and right sides of the square
  6 = Walls on the top and left sides of the square
  7 = Walls on the right, top, and left sides of the square
  8 = Wall on the bottom of the square only
  9 = Walls on the bottom and right sides of the square
10 = Walls on the top and bottom of the square
11 = Walls on the top, bottom, and right sides of the	square
12 = Walls on the bottom and left sides of the square
13 = Walls on the bottom, right, and left sides of the square
14 = Walls on the top, bottom, and left sides of the square
15 = Walls on the right, top, bottom, and left sides of the	square

So, the maze shown in this picture:
  
Would be translated into this:

6
  6 10  2  2 10  3
12  3  5 12 10  1
  4  1 12 10  3  5
  5  4  3  6  9  5
  5  5  5 12 10  1
12  9 12 10 10  9

After you have made a maze and added it to your mazes.txt file, send the file to the other person you will be playing with. If both players do not have the same mazes.txt file, unexpected results may occur. Remember that the first number in the file is the total number of mazes in the file. Don’t forget to update this number when you add new mazes.
