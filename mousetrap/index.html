        <pre>This game uses a third-person chase camera, with simple interaction with other objects, for example collision with walls.  The basic idea is that you and your lovely wife were turned into mice and then separated by an evil wizard. The goal of the game is to reunite with your wife.  As a mouse you are limited by your size.  You will, however, maintain your human intellect and as such are able to solve complex puzzles.   These puzzles form the basis for our game. The gameplay is unlike most platformers outside of the running and jumping because the challenge is based on environmental puzzles rather than a simple combat system.  The physical scaling in this game provides for lots of interesting puzzles.
