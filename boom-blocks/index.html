        <pre>Boom Blocks Proto

          --Installation--
          
          Run "Setup.exe" to install the game
           
          -- Gameplay --
          
          Align 3 or more blocks of the color to cause them to explode and score points.  If a block sits idle for some time, it may harden, preventing it from exploding normal.  For blocks in this state, you must align "Boom Blocks" which generate large explosions that have the ability to explode hardened blocks.

          -- Controls--
          
          W: Swap Clusters
          A: Move Cluster Left
          S: Move Cluster Down
          D: Move Cluster Right
          SPACEBAR: Rotate cluster 90 degrees

          -- Music --
          
          You may choose to have background music play during gameplay.  To do this, you much create a folder titled "music" in the main install directory.  Place your music files in the files in this folder (NOTE: the files MUST be in .ogg format).  Open "music.txt" in the main install directory and type in the filenames ("x.ogg") of the music you'd like to play from the music folder, each on its own line.  Upon beginning gameplay, the music will play in order of the filenames in music.txt and playback will automatically loop around. 
          
          Enjoy!
