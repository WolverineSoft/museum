        <p class="warning">We could not get this game to work. The finished game is a debug build that errors stating its side-by-side configuration is invalid when it is run
because it needs a Debug CRT from Visual Studio 2005. The release build draws a black window. The download includes the game's source code, so it might be possible
to make a new build but we have not succeeded yet.</p>
