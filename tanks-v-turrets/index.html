       <pre>*** Issues running the game ***

If having issues running 'Launcher.exe', try installing the files in the 'redist' folder:

- dxwebsetup_9.26.1590.exe - DirectX (March 2009)
- oalinst_2.0.7.0.exe - OpenAL SDK 3.05

and depending on your processor, one of:
- vcredist_x86_9.0.30729.17.exe - Visual Studio 2008 (x86)
- vcredist_x64_9.0.30729.17.exe - Visual Studio 2008 (x64)

These ensure that you have the libraries required to run the game installed.


*** Level editing ***

The 'levels' folder
  contains all of the level data. You can play around with the existing levels or make your own.
To add a level to the game, you will need to add its path to 'levels/levels.txt'. You can also modify this file to change which levels are loaded in the game and in what order.
Details of the syntax for level files are in 'levels/level
  syntax.txt'.
