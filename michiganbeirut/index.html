        <pre>Michigan Beirut

          This game was written in C using HAM, a gba library. The graphics were created in inkscape and paint, and downsampled for the gba. 
          
          The game is meant to be simple and addictive.
        </pre>
        <pre>The game is a simulation of the popular drinking game beirut (beerpong). You must find the best combination of angle and power in order to land your ball into your opponent’s cups. After landing a ball in a cup, that cup will disappear, if you lose all your cups, you lose the game. If all of your opponent’s cups disappear, you win. Each player alternates throwing the ball.

The angle pointer and power meter will move on their own, use the A button to lock each, one at a time.

        <pre>7:30 - contest begins
9:45 - empty table graphic is complete, colors look ok on gba
10:32 - got sprites (just the cups right now) to display on the gba, need to setup positions
12:08 - enemy cup sprites are in position
        need to setup player character sprite, player cups
12:30 - got all cups lined up
	need to show player's sprite (as tiled bg?)
1:30 - got player sprite as a tiled bg
2:30 - eat pizza
3:00 - return to central campus, sleep, etc

12:30 - returned to contest, begun putting aim arrow on screen
13:00 - after much strange behavior, i finally got 
13:54 - initial aim mechanism works, working on text output
14:31 - got text output engine working
15:00 - improved cup graphics, really need to start implementing basic gameplay
        next step: make power meter
16:17 - powermeter + bar are made, need aiming mechanism
16:53 - powermeter implemented, need to code a utility to generate tan() lookup tables for degrees
17:14 - created tan lookup table by writing a seperate program, 
	now need to test actual aiming mechanism for accuracy
17:57 - wildly innaccurate, debug time.
18:16 - found lots of bugs in getpower(), power is accurate now, 
	but the shots are still landing wrong
21:20 - discovered that offsets were necessary, bugs fixed, need to do animation for flying ball
22:11 - working on animation still, weird issues with rounding player cup positions
22:49 - actual travel animation is ok, want to add some kind of zoom effect.
23:36 - added zoom effect, working on collision detection to find when shots go in
1:50 - collision detection is not really working. been debugging forever
2:39 - the collision bounding boxes i'm using don't make any sense, but they seem to make the game playable enough
3:43 - I believe I've narrowed the collision issue to some kind of coordinate strangeness, 
	i have some constant correction factors in place that allieviate the issues
4:06 - the player's part of the gameplay is basically done, next I need to code the ai
5:11 - we have an AI, need to make it so it can miss shots
8:36 - woke up from nap. AI is done need title screen/sound effects
11:02 - added bitchin' music. need to make a "you win" screen.
12:32 - drew winning screens, need to draw losing screens and pretty up the actual game
14:06 - started integrating winning screens, added cool scrolling clouds ingame
15:35 - fixed issue with winning screen, integrating all winning story screens now w/ music
16:14 - winning screen works with story, need to make losing screen
16:55 - game is completely playable
19:30 - various bugfixes, cleanups, polish
