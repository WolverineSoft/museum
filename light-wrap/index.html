        <pre>V-Studio Arcade Volume 2 - Release 1: Light Wrap Beta
          by Christopher Shell
          
Objective:
Manuever your light around the screen avoiding collisions with the walls, other lights, or
any light trails.  You may choose to play defensively and aim to just survive, or play
aggressively and try to trap your opponents.

Controls:
Select options on main menu using the directional keys.  Up/Down switches rows, Left/Right
toggles the option in each row.  

NOTE: Only Level 1 is playable in this demo, no matter which level you choose.

During gameplay, each human player is assigned a set of four keys to move their light
depending on which player they are:

Player 1: 
Directional Keys

Player 2:
Up: W
Down: S
Left: A
Right: D

Player 3:
Up: I
Down: K
Left: J
Right: L

Player 4:
Up: T
Down: G
Left: F
Right: H

Once all options have been chosen, press "Enter" to begin the round.
The last player to survive is declared the winner of the round and is announced so. Press
enter to return to the main menu.  Rounds can be quit at anytime by pressing "Q".  Exit the
game at anytime by pressing the escape key.


Tips and Notes:
- I recommend mixing up your strategies, play aggresively when you feel you should, play 
defensive when you feel the need but try not to let other players scope out habits.

- If you're trying to force a player to ram into a trail, keep in mind that the head of the
light must impact a core axial point of the trail (in other words, you may see that the 
collision detection still needs some work).

- Before you (and hopefully your friends) play the game and start reminding 
yourselves of it over and over again: I KNOW THE A.I. SUCKs.  There, I admit it.  But also
keep in mind that this a game that is truly meant to be played with as many human 
competitors as possible.  Not to brag or anything but I personally feel 3-4 people
going at it in this game (despite the arguably cramped shared keyboard controls) can be
quite fun despite being such a simple gameplay concept.

- As this is an early playable build beta, yes, i'm sure there are bugs and i'm sure there
are things that need tweaking.  I'm working on it and i'd appreciate any comments, concerns
and bug reports you can send me at:

Enjoy! (hopefully)
