Sometimes, in order to properly configure DoubleShot, you need to set the
game path so that the program can locate its files. If the game does not
start, or starts as a completely black or white screen, it is likely that
the game path will need to be configured correctly.

In order to do this, you have two options:

1. You can copy the DoubleShot folder to the C: drive so that the full
path of the DoubleShot directory is C:\DoubleShot\

or

2. You can edit the first line of the file "gamepath.txt" to correspond
  to the folder where DoubleShot is located. "gamepath.txt" is found in
  the DoubleShot folder. Use '\\' instead of '\'.
  Example: C:\DoubleShot\ becomes C:\\DoubleShot\\

DoubleShot should now be configured correctly, good luck defeating the Orgo!

Q: Is there a two player mode?

A: Not yet.

Q: Why is the game called DoubleShot then?

A: Because your ship can shoot in two directions with its primary weapon.
Also, because when we were trying to name our game 46+ hours into the competition
the only inspiring game title to come to our minds came from a "double shot" of
expresso we had availible to keep us going ;).

Q: Where did the starfield background come from?

A: The starfield, though it looks rather professionally done, was made by Chris
Boguslawski in photoshop during the first day of the competition. Chris has a bit
of artistic talent in addition to programming skill. Artun did the vast majority
of the other art in the game, while Brian designed our intimidating boss ship.

Q: Is the entire game only one level long?

A: No, this level was designed and mostly put together during WolverineSoft's
48-hour video game development competition.  But there are more to come...

Q: Why release this uncompleted game?

A: This demo exists to give players a taste of what the full game will be like.
The full game will consist of several more levels, many more enemies, and cool
special effects, etc.

Q: When will the full game be released?

A: Unfortunately, at this time, the entire development team is busy with school
so DoubleShot can only be worked on in our spare time. Hopefully, the game will
be finished within a year, but nothing is for certain.

Q: Why is this game so buggy?

A: This game was written in 48-hours and was hastily assembled with minimal
testing of components. Unfortunately, bugs thrive under such a development
environment. Many bugs have been corrected for this version of the game, but
many still lurk undiscovered. The full version of the game will be more bug
free and polished.

Q: Why do I get a black screen when I start the game?

A: It is probably because the directories have been improperly configured.
To fix this problem, follow the steps outlined above in 'Configuration'.

Q: Why is there no music/sound? Why are no images loading?

A: See previous question.

Thanks to Dave Ratti for the usage of his SoundManager class.

Thanks to WolverineSoft for putting on another great 48-hour competition.

And lastly but most importantly, thanks to you for taking interest in our
game. We hope you enjoy it!
