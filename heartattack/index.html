Heart Attack

Game should be very straightforward; the tutorial should be all you need.

Sandbox=cheat mode. You cant die, so you can see how the game progresses.

The game plays much better on an analog stick, but is still pretty fun with the keyboard. You just have to be more cautios if you are playing on the keyboard: your aim isnt as good and its harder to move. If you work at one color corner block at a time you should be ok. 

I did all the art and code for the game. It was built off a psuedo-engine I did over the summer. I made all the art and found all the soundFX through google and www.flashkit.com (very nice site). The music was done by Jay Semerad. The tracks are on his website: www.redleaderaudio.com. I used fmod for sound.

Multiplayer is the most fun, especially if you can play with 4 people.

Game only runs in 1024x768. I tested it in the visualation lab and it ran very well. 

Cell shading effect is done by just copying and scaling each mesh and flipping vertex order (culling must be on).

Issues/features I wanted to add:
-Collision detection could be better
-Balance the single player game a little more or make different difficulty

        Confirmed working on Windows 11. The game was designed for 1024x768. Widescreen displays will stretch the game.
