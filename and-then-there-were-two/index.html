        <p>Author: Rui Dong and Jim Yang (Duck Duck)</p><p><br></p><p>Game Description: This game is a two player game using ps4 controllers. There will be two role, attacker and defender, which will be assigned randomly&nbsp;10 seconds after the game started. The attacker&#x27;s purpose is to catch the defender. And the defender needs to try as hard as he can to avoid the attacker. The game ends when one of the situations happens: one player jumps out of the map, the defender gets caught, or the 30 second time limit has passed.</p>
