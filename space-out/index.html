-Objective & Gameplay-
Space Out: V-Style is an enhanced completion of a prototype designed and developed by
Michael Morrison presented in his book "Beginning Game Programming".  It is a variation
of the Space Invaders formula. You are a lone defender and wheelman of a vehicle armed with 
an anti-alien missile launcher tasks with defending your homeland from an invasion of aliens
from an unknown origin.

You begin the game with 5 lives with bonus lives awarded for defeating bosses.
The game ends either when all your lives are depleted, or all alien attack waves have been
countered.  Your highest score is automatically recorded and displayed on the main screen.


-Controls-
Direction keys left and right move the defender left and right respectively.  The spacebar
is used to fire anti-alien missiles.  Hold down the spacebar for rapid firing.  Press 'Q'
at any time during gameplay to quit your current game and return to the main menu.  Press
the escape key at any time to close the game.


-Developer Hints & Tips-
- Paying homage to old-school arcade shooters (and my own personal affinity for challenging
rail shooters like Ikaruga and Raiden), you may find Space Out: V-Style to be a very
challenging game to master and complete successfully.  This challenge is the substance
of the game, so my first tip to you is...PERSIST.  The game is challenging, but not 
impossible, so keep at it and you'll likely find yourself progressing further and further
through the game as you build skill at it.  (Try to outdo yourself score-wise in the
process!)

- The defender has the ability to go off the screen and wrap around to the other side.  Use
this to your advantage, especially in the boss battles when you're trying to avoid boss
bombs and counter-attack simulatenously.

- Your score decreases every time you fire a missile.  While this tip may not be practical
in the late levels of the game, in earlier levels, at least, try not to mindlessly fire 
off too many missiles trying the kill the last few aliens of the wave.

- When you respawn after dying, you are granted a few seconds of immunity from enemy fire,
use this opportunity to "scatter-fire" missiles to clear out the area a bit, providing you
some relief, especially if you are getting showered.


-Release Notes-
This is version 1.1 of the game that fixes a bug that will cause the game to stutter, then quickly kill a boss if hit near the beginning of a boss level.  If you have an earlier version of the game, just replace the executable of that version with this one and disregard all other files to maintain your high score.
