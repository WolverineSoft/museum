After completing a long night of sprikling sand into the eyes of sleepy children of Earth, The Sand Man as usual was feeling
a bit peckish.  On any normal night, The Sand Man would have gone home to Sand Land to fill his tummy.  But this was a
special night.  It was the night before Christmas, and all the little children left out milk and cookies for Santa Clause.
On seeing all of the milk and cookies left for Santa, The Sand Man got increasingly jelous.  "Why should I have to go back
to Sand Land, where all there is to eat is sand," he thought to himself, "I give these children wonderful dreams every night
and I get nothing.  But Santa comes once a year and brings presents and he gets millions of glasses of milk and millions
of cookies."  So in a fit of jelousy, The Sand Man took home a bundle of bananas to snack on back home.  "Just one bundle,"
he thought, "can't hurt anything..."  Little did he know he was being followed by the Monkey Horde, who are always looking
for more bananas to feed thier massive numbers.  When The Sand Man got back to Sand Land, he found it overrun with monkies!
Monkies that were tring to steal his bananas!  Help The Sand Man defend Sand Land, the land of limmitless sand needed to 
give the children all the dreams imaginable, from the Monkey Horde.  If he fails, there will be a world of no more dreams!

* HOW TO PLAY *
*             *
***************

Controls:

Mouse              - move cursor
Left mouse button  - fire gun
Right mouse button - throw grenade

W     - up
A     - left
S     - down
D     - right
E     - reload machine gun
Space - run


Guns:

The machine gun is the default gun.  It has unlimmited ammo, but needs to be reloaded every 40 rounds.  When you pick up 
shotgun shells the machine gun is replaced with a shotgun until your amount of shells runs out.  To throw a grenade, 
position the cursor on the area you want it to land, then right click.  Careful, grenades can't go though walls!  If a bullet
or explosion touch a barrel, it will explode.  


Movement: 

The sand man can't move backwards as quickly as he can move downwards.  Make sure you make him face the direction he is 
going by positioning the cursor in the direction he is moving.  When you hold down space, the sand man will be able to move
faster than the monkeys but his energy bar will drain.  Once it is gone, there is noway to out run the monkeys!


Items:

Health Pack   - Will increase your health by 25, you can increase your life above 100
Stimpack      - Refills energy, and allows you to run for 15 seconds without using any energy
Box of Shells - Adds 15 shells to your ammunition
Grenade Belt  - Adds 5 grenades to your grenade belt
Banana        - The moment you touch this item, you win the game!
Barrel        - If a barrel is hit by a bullet or explosion, it will create an explosion of its own!


Monkeys:

As you search for the banana, the monkey hoard will try and slow your progress by sending a rediculus amout of monkeys to 
kill you.  They are killed by any explosion or bullet, but watch out, you will have trouble trudging though the monkey
corpses so try not to block your path!  If they touch you, they will bite you repeadily until you are again out of range.


Goal:

The goal of the game is to collect the banana so the monkies have no more reason to ravage sand land.
