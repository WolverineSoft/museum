        <pre>PolaritySwitch v1.2

TO SET DESIRED SCREEN RESOLUTION: 
- Adjust the values in config/zenilib.xml
- Note that the game plays slightly different with different screen resolutions


For a solo, 48-hour game, I'm pretty happy with the way this came out.  It's more 
of a proof-of-concept than a full game. If I had a larger team (2 people) or more 
time, I definitely would have spent more time doing enemy/firing pattern/level 
design. I think there could be some interesting interactions between the two modes,
attract/repel (offensive/defensive).  As it is right now, you spend most of your 
time in offensive mode, because the enemies never force you into defense.
