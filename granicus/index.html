        <b>Game Description:</b>
        <p>
        Players play as space ships shaped roughly as “equals” signs. The objective is to destroy the opposing ship(s) by shooting at them. Players may dodge incoming shots either by simply moving out of the way, or by rotating the ship such that the shot flies through the gap between the “lines”. Shots bounce off of the perimeter, and may cause friendly fire damage. An additional player may control “Granicus”, and have the ability to draw barriers across the screen. These barriers block both the shots and the ships themselves. The objective of Granicus is to prevent the ships from destroying each other, and wins if more than one ship is remaining at the end of the time limit.
</p>
<b>Incorporation of Theme:</b>
<p>
  The theme is “fight”, and the objective of the game for the ships is to fight the other ships and destroy them. The objective of “Granicus”, the line player, is to “break up the fight”, and prevent the other players from winning.
The river Granicus was the site of an ancient battle between Alexander the Great and the Persian Empire. At the start of the battle the two armies were lined up on either side of the river, and the river acted as an obstacle during the battle. This parallels our game, where the line player (“Granicus”) works in opposition to the ongoing battle.
