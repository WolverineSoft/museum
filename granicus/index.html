        <sectionheader>Description</sectionheader>
        A two-player space battle game
        <pre>Improvements since 48 hour contest:

Support for keyboard controls for players 1 and 2.
Non-configurable joystick support for player 1.
Lines no longer draw farther than their maximum length.
Lines disappear immediately if there are too many lines on the screen.

Lines turn green if they can be placed, red if they cannot (if there are 5 lines on the screen).
Sounds for line hit, ship hit, and ship destroy.
        </pre>
