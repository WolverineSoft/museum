       <pre>Shoot! v0.5

A simple networked game developed for linux, currently in Beta.

controls:
arrow keys move and turn your character (currently simultaneously)
space fires a rocket in your current direction

play mechanics:
your character is shown in white, enemies in red
your character dies on collision with a rocket or another player
new players start on the next new round
current player cap is 16 (tested up to 7)

startup:
commandline
first player runs
%shoot
subsequent players run
%shoot -i <name or ip of first player's computer>

the flag -p followed by a number indicates that this game is run by an automated character
-p 1 runs a circle player, other players not yet implemented

The current version assumes a common port number so will only work within a subnet (lan) and only 1 player can run per machine

future features (if we get around to them):
handle disconnects (currently the game locks up if a player disconnects)
maps
powerups
various automated players
internet play
separate direction and movement
