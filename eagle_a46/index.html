        <pre>A-46 is a 2-dimensional, side-scrolling, shooter game.  Game mechanics involve avoidance of moving obstacles and enemies, aiming and firing at moving targets, performing well-timed air dodges, gathering power-ups, and ultimately racking up a killer high score to brag about.  The player can move in the eight cardinal directions, fire shotgun shells horizontally, drop bombs vertically, and perform an air dodge to avoid incoming obstacles and enemies.  All of this is done while astride a flying mount. 

Eagle A-46 has three distinct enemies and three distinct power-ups.  Ground-based enemies sport a shoulder-mounted rocket-propelled grenade launcher that they fire up into the sky at the player, parachuting enemies fall steadily to the ground while blasting away with a sturdy AK-47 until touching down and launching RPGs as well, and lastly a piloted aircraft harasses the player from the edge of the screen with bursts of machinegun fire.  Power-ups include health replenishment, temporary damage reduction, and temporary scoring bonuses.

Fitting the Theme:
  In our game, Eagle A-46, Stephen Colbert displays his unwavering patriotism by taking up arms in support of the United States troops in Iraq along with his trusty eagle Stephen Jr. (a.k.a. Eagle A-46 according to Wikiality).  In Iraq Stephen and his trusty avian companion are confronted by the greatest threat to humanity…terrorist bears more commonly referred to as bear-orrists.
  
  
  This game honors Stephen's loyalty to his country, his friends, and his fellow man.  He personally fights the battles too great for the rest of us, ensuring our safety and saving countless lives of brave American soldiers.  He is the truest of patriots and our game is aimed at underlining that fact.
