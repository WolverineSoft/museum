Crisis Wolverine 2: Shadows of the Past
---------------------------------------

Patch 1.1 Information:

- Fixed a few minor bugs in the game.

- Added a new feature to the end of the game.


Launching information:

  If you do not run the trailer during the script, you can run it
  by clicking on the "Crisis Wolverine 2 Shadows of the Past" shortcut. 
  
  
Performance suggestions:
  
  1. For best performance, disable AIM notifications or sign off completely.

  2. Close all CPU intensive programs before playing the trailer.


Troubleshooting:

  1.  I get an error close to "RPG Maker 2003 run time 
      package is not present or not registered"

        - Run the CW2 Setup.exe file and follow the onscreen 
          instructions.  Restart your computer and try again.

  2.  The game does not play well in full screen mode.
  
  - Press f4 to reduce the screen to windowed mode.
  - Press f5 to toggle the size of your window.

  3.  There is very little music in the game.

        - Copy the .dll files from the "System Files" folder.
  - Paste them into your Windows/System32 folder.
        - Restart your computer and try again.

  4.  The fonts are not displaying well, or at all.

        - First, restart your computer and try again
      
      If that doesn't work:
  - Copy the .ttc file given in the Fonts folder.
  - Paste them into your C:\Windows\Fonts folder.
  - Restart your computer and try again.
