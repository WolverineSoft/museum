<pre>Lucid Dreams - The Struggle to Awaken
  In this game, you must avoid the sleeping pills thrown by the sheep who want you to sleep forever.  To defeat the sheep you must catch the sleeping pills thrown at you and throw the pill back at the sheep to put them to sleep. To awaken from your dream, you must collect caffeine pills dropped by the sheep you put to sleep. Sheep also drop ritalin, which slows down the player, and speed pills, which make the player faster.  If the sheep force to many sleeping pills on you, you lose the game and sleep forever.

  This game is relates to the theme because it is "in your dreams".
