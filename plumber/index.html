SUMMERY

Plumber is a variation on the many arrange pipes puzzle games.  Each level consists of multiple sources of flow, with the player's objective being to arrange pipes to create a path for at least a certain number of these flow sources to designation flow exits.  See the program's help page for more information.

EXECUTING LINUX

In short, you are probably better off compiling from source.  For the brave, certain distributions have precompiled versions of clan lib (notably Ubuntu 8.10's libclanlib-dev).  The Linux precompiled version is 32-bit and links against all parts of ClanLib expect the hermes.  If you come into troubles, running ldd on the Plumber executable should help identify any missing libraries.

EXECUTING WINDOWS

Completely statically compiled, 32-bit.  Click and go.  Weee.

COMPILING LINUX

The included Makefile may require a few tweaks, notably the path to the clanlib directory.  Nonetheless, it should be sufficient to compile Plumber on a system with ClanLib 0.8.1 installed.

COMPILING WINDOWS

The Windows installation is compiled under Linux using mingw.  See the Makefile.mingw file for more details, but you are mostly on your own for this.

        Confirmed working on Windows 10. The close window button does not work and the game does not properly resize to fit in the window.
