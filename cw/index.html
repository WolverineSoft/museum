ASCII Entertainment

This game was created with "RPG no tsukuru 2000" by ASCII Entertainment. Some sound effects, music, and art used in CW-IG is from this program. Please email me at CW-IG@umich.edu if you would like to know the break down of which art/music/sound was created by our team. (Generally speaking, all of the MP3 music, and any art/design clearly associated with the University of Michigan or MSU was created by our team.)

QUICK HINTS: Save often. 
              Use potions in and between battles. 
        Buy a lot of magic replenishing items, they really help.
              Use Tech Skills, they can really turn the battle around.
              Remember to equip all weapons/amour in the menu screen right after
                  you get them.</pre>
