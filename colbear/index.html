        <pre>Project Name:   Colbert Crisis

Project Description:
Our game is a top down shooter from the perspective of Stephen Colbert.  
He shoots, burns, and impales the bears that were at one point human,
but changed due to a bio weapons lab explosion.  Their goal is to take
down all humans, but Stephen Colbert is an obstruction to their plan
for world domination.

Fitting the Theme:
Stephen Colbert is the protagonist of this game.  The bears obviously
respect Stephen Colbert's world changing influential power such that 
they target him so fervishly.  Also, we figure that making him 
the president of the United States for "winning the game" is a great
honor to bestow.  Furthermore, we not only make mention of his role in
the "Colbert Report" but we also make references to "Harvey Birdman
Attorney at Law" in which he voiced the characters "Phil Ken Sebben" 
and "Reducto."  We have even gone so far as to make a bear version
of the "Phil Ken Sebben" character (seen in the tutorial).

Framework: DXFramework version 1.0  made by John Voight
