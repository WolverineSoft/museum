=== ExSphere by Mark Diehr ===
==========================

ExSphere is a game where you destroy tiles with a roving ball.
All instructions are in game, but there are additional tips in this document.
Important note: This game requires the installation of the August 2005 DirectX update (included), and a graphics
card that supports Direct3D (not included).

=== Basic Controls ===

↔ : Move
↑↓ : Begins moving when frozen
R : Resets the ball. You lose 1 life.
Esc : Exit to the menu. (Or to windows if you are already at the menu)

=== Game Mechanics ===

The goal of ExSphere is to destroy all of the destroyable blocks on each level.
This includes everything except the indestructible walls, skulls, and power ups.
The ball goes up and down of its own accord.
You control the movement with ← and →.
At the beginning of the level, and whenever you die, the ball is frozen.
Press ↑ or ↓ to begin moving. Once moving, ↑ and ↓ slow your horizontal motion.
Destroy blocks by running into them. You can only destroy blocks that match your current Key Block, shown in the
lower left corner with a blue border. To change your current Key Block collide with any tile that has a green border.
White blocks have no Key, so you cannot switch back to white after picking a different Key Block. Once you hit the
golden Key Block you cannot switch back. Ice blocks can be destroyed at any time.
Don't hit skulls, or you lose a life.

=== Collectable Items ===

The fireball powerup lets you destroy any block.
The hammerball powerup lets you plow right through blocks that you can destroy.
Collect 50 crystals to get an extra life.

=== Tips ===

Plan out the path of your ball before you start moving.
When you need to straighten out the path of your ball, hold ↑ or ↓ to reduce your horizontal motion.
Tiles with green borders will change what type of tile you can get.
Get all of the white tiles first. There is no key block for white.
Get all of the gold tiles last. You cannot access key blocks once you switch to gold.

=== Laird Mode ===

Press F5 or F8 to go back or forward in the levels.
Press 'L' when within a level to set your lives to 25.

=== Non-Supported Features ===

The Entire Editor is unsupported, though if you are an intrepid pioneer you can figure it out. The main level set is
stored in main.cfg in a simple endline-delimited list.
* Pressing E in a level or from the menu opens the editor
* Pressing T when editing tests the level (discarding changes since your last save)
* Pressing S saves the level
* Pressing L reloads the level
* Middle-Click moves the ball position.
* Click on a button to pick that type for drawing.
* Left-Click to draw that tile or item.
* Right-Click to erase either a tile or an item (depending on which is selected)
* Right-Click when erase is selected to erase a 3x3 chunk.

* DEL deletes all tiles.
* Backspace deletes all items.

=== Misc ===
The background image is taken from the Fractal-of-the-day mailing list sometime in 2004.
The crystal is an item from Heroes of Might and Magic II, modified and animated by myself.
All other textures were made from scratch in Adobe Photoshop.
All sounds were made from scratch in Stomper32.
